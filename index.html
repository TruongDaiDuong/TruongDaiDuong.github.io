        <h3>&emsp; 1. Team profile</h3>
        <p><strong>&emsp; a. Team name:</strong>
            <br>
            <br>&emsp;    When it comes to my mind what my team name will be, I think the 
            name will be Hard-working Crew. Because in my opinion the team name will reflect 
            our team’s personalities a lot, and I believe that I will find a team where I can 
            meet people who are friendly, and willing to learn and work. Also, I hope that when 
            employers see our team name, they can trust that this team has good and hard-working 
            members. That is why I name my team Hard-working Crew.

        <br><center><img src="images/Capture8.PNG" style="width:600px;height:300px"></center>
        <br>&emsp; Through the three online tests, I have found that I am very supportive, 
        good at solving problem and hard-working. But I am also shy and humble a lot. 
        Because of that, I would like to find and work with team members who are also hard-working, 
        they do not have to be very smart and intelligent but are willing to learn and try their
         best to cooperate with team. It will also be better for me if I can meet dynamic and 
         sociable members since I do not talk much and very bashful.
         <br>
         <br>&emsp; I think the most important factors that make up success of a project are 
         the combination of teamwork, diligent, creative and meet the requirements of the project. 
         Every member in a team will support each other to overcome difficulties and challenges. 
         That will contribute the most to the group’s success.

        <h3>&emsp; 3. Project idea</h3>
        <p>&emsp; I think the necessary tools are Visual Studio Code, HTML, PyCharm and more which 
            I will gain knowledge in my studies in the future. 
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; And talking about IT innovations, I would like to see an IT innovation about 
        cybersecurity. IT industries have been growing strongly in Vietnam recent years and in 
        my opinion, cybersecurity technology is one of the most important things that need to be 
        focus on. Not only do it protect private information for the customers, but also, it will 
        become a necessary tool to full-pledged antivirus. And I have also seen that the key focus 
        of the technology strategy of most companies is cybersecurity, so maybe it will bring good 
        salary if I am able to success in this field. What is more, developing this project will also 
        help me to expand the necessary skills, experiences and knowledges such as English skills 
        (which is mandatory), creative, data management, etc. 
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Overview</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; The IT worlds are variable, and there are lots of IT project I am interesting in. 
        But what I am most passionate about is developing a website which will provide services to
         the customers. And talking about what kind of website is it, it is going to be a website
          that selling gaming products like consoles, game disc, etc. I am not the one who is going 
          to sell the products, but I will be the one who create a website, to connect the game stores
           to the customers. My plan is creating a website at first, then, if there is an opportunity 
           (if possible), then from the website I will create a smartphone app to provide services more
            fluently and more convenient.
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Motivation</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; For many years ago, game has become popular in Vietnam and it will never be out 
        of time. The reasons I think this project will be interesting and useful is because I think 
        game industry will grow strongly in Vietnam. There have been some game stores start opening 
        in Vietnam more and more, but lots of them have not developed a website or make it convenient 
        for the customers. So, the products will be harder to advertise and reach to the customers. 
        In that case, I want to create a website that will be mainly focus on gaming consoles and keep 
        track of new products for customers. 
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Description</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; This project aim is to create a website for the game store and make it convenient, 
        easy-to-use for the customers. It will manage the products for the game store: availability, 
        prices, … and some tools and features for the customers like search, sort, carts, login page,
         etc. and purchase through online. In this report, I will focus mainly on the services for the 
         customers.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; On the main page of the website, first it will advertise some hot and new gaming 
        products. Next, the customers will also see some quality-of-life functions like search, sort, 
        filter.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Search bar will allow customers to search for the products they want to see. 
        This will include all products like discs, consoles, etc. If they want to sort by game genre 
        or what kind of consoles and platform, they can use the filter and sort bars. 
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; When the customers click on the products they want to see, it will display the 
        name, prices and discounts (if any). There will also be some detail descriptions, ratings 
        and comments from other customers. Maybe on the left or bottom of the page will also display 
        some similar products so that customers can check these out.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; If the users use sort and filter, it will show a list of products that similar 
        to the filter and sort information the users had entered.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; The users will also have the member login functions if they sign up for the store.
         I think sign up will be mandatory for the customers if they want to purchase products through
          the online websites. 
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; When the users sign up and land on the member page, they will see their information 
        (name, address, email, phone, etc.). Next, they will also see their shopping cart to display 
        the products that currently they want to buy. There will also be purchase history so that 
        the users can view the purchase histories. If I am good enough, I also want to create a GPS 
        function where customers can keep track of the products they have purchased and on the way 
        to their destination through delivery. 
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Tools and technologies</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; In order to create this website, several tools and equipment will be needed. 
        From what I have seen from the Internet, the common tools for creating a website are HTML, 
        CSS, JavaScript, so, Visual Studio Code and GitHub will be a good choice for these tools. 
        MySQL and Oracle will also be necessary for managing database, Python will be used for 
        coding, and PyCharm will support all of these.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Browsers like Internet Explorer or Google Chrome will be useful to test the 
        website in order to check if there are any errors, bugs and make sure it works properly 
        (also on mobile devices like phones and tablets too). 
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Skills required</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Skills required for this project are variable. Using tool skills like PyCharm, 
        GitHub, coding is mandatory if I want to create a good-looking and easy-to-use website 
        with less errors or bugs. Language skills are also important if I want my website to 
        reach many customers so Vietnamese and English are necessary. Of course, I cannot work 
        this project on my own so I will need some teammates to do this. In that case, teamwork 
        will be the key factor to solve this problem. And the most important in my opinion is 
        cybersecurity knowledges and skills in order to protect the user’s private information.
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Outcome</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; If the project is successful, there will lots of benefits and problems can 
        also be solved. The game stores can sell the products and they can reach to the customers. 
        Customers will also find a reliable website to find and purchase these products through online.
        Moreover, like I have said, if there is an opportunity, I will create a smartphone app which 
        will be more convenient than the website. One of the problems can be solved is that now these 
        gaming products can easily reach to the customers and they can also find a reliable game 
        store website in Vietnam.
        </p>
        &emsp;
        <h3>&emsp; 4. Feedback</h3>
        <p>
        &emsp; In order to receive feedbacks and ideas about my project, I have asked and 
        received feedbacks from two students in my class. These are the questions that I have asked:
        <ol>
            <li>How do you think about this project? Do you have any interested in it?</li>
            <li>Do you think this project can be possible to success in the future?</li>
            <li>Are there any advices you can give me to improve this project?</li>
        </ol>
        &emsp; Both are very interested in this project, and they advise me to continue to work on it. 
        Another feedback is that they think this project is a good way to advertise the products and 
        timesaving for customers to check them online. However, both think that this project will be 
        hard to success in the future since people will prefer going directly to the store to check 
        the quality rather than buying them through online, because these products are usually very 
        expensive. Another reason is that nowadays, people hardly-ever buy discs because there are 
        already some video game digital distribution services like Steam which will provide videogame 
        through clouds and Internet. They advise me to keep working on it since it is my project idea 
        and do my best in building this project through gaining knowledges and keep tracks of new 
        technology to improve it.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; I have found many useful advices through this feedback thanks to my friends. 
        I agree and also disagree some points. I agree that this project will be hard to success 
        because I do not sure about the outcomes and I have not gained skills to develop this project, 
        not to mention that can I overcome difficulties in the future. I disagree that less people 
        will buy these products through online because as long as I can make a reliable website and 
        manage good qualities of the stores, then I can gain trust from customers. Regardless of 
        how good or bad these advices, I still can use these for future improvement. In order to 
        make the project success, I need to seek a lot of feedbacks and advices from other people 
        and use these to improve the project.

        <h3>&emsp; 5. IT Technologies</h3>
        <p>
        &emsp; In this section, I will discuss some relevant areas to this project. 
        In my opinion, cloud computing and cybersecurity, privacy are the two most relevant 
        to my project.
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Cloud computing</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Cloud computing has become a popular technology and it has been used all 
        around the world and especially large companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, etc. 
        So, what does it really do?
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Cloud computing is a technology that provides computing resources for the 
        users through the Internet. These resources are anything related to computing, it 
        can be a software, service, data, … and they will be stored on the Internet. Users 
        can connect to any of these resources on cloud, at anytime and anywhere, as long as 
        they have Internet connection.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Before cloud computing was invented, when we wanted to do something, we had 
        to spend a lot of investments from beginning to the end. For personal use, if we wanted 
        to store data, we had to buy a hard drive. If we wanted to manage your store business, 
        we had to buy our own management software and download it on our computers. Not only that, 
        but we also had to spend money on maintenance. For example, if the hard drive is broken, 
        we have to replace or fix it. Besides, in order to avoid the risks of losing data, we have 
        to back up our data frequently in another drive, which make it really inconvenient. 
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; That is for personal use, but for large company like Microsoft, the maintenance 
        fees are a lot more because their management system is really big and complicated, with 
        data in and out continuously, so that is why only a small error can make them lose a ton 
        of millions dollar. They will also have to spend a lot of money on staffs in order to check, 
        test, run and update their system. 
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Then cloud computing has been invented, and it has solved many problems. 
        Whenever we want to back up our files, there are OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive to 
        help us. We do not have to use our own hard drives and maintain anymore, because the 
        companies who provide cloud computing have already done that. If the hard drive is broken, 
        they will automatically replace it and backup the data. For the companies, they have moved 
        their apps and software into cloud. The users only need to open the browser, click and then 
        they can access to the software. They do not have to have to download on their computer anymore.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; These are the most common benefits of cloud computing:
        <ul>
            <li>The biggest benefit is money and time saving.</li>
            <li>Cloud computing is very convenient, as long as we have access to the Internet.</li>
            <li>Cloud computing also provide data safety and continuity</li>
        </ul>
        &emsp; Cloud computing has become the key factor influencing promoting the business process 
        of many companies, and help these companies work more fluently
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; On the other hand, it also has some potential problems that we must deal with. 
        Nowadays, in Vietnam, cloud computing has continued to grow a lot but there are still some 
        drawbacks:
        <ul>
            <li>First, every company has different scale, organization model and different fields. 
                That is why when these companies switch to this technology, which is cloud computing, 
                they will have to face some big challenges like capital source, investment costs, 
                production costs, management, etc.</li>
            <li>Second, cloud computing relies a lot on bandwidth speed, which will impact direct 
                to the connection of the users, causing them to lose connection.</li>
            <li>Finally, is about the cybersecurity problem. Every company must find a way in order 
                to protect the important information from threats and hackers.</li>
        </ul>
        &emsp; Cloud computing also leaves a lot of impacts around us. Cloud computing has become 
        a very popular technology and it has been focused by lots of companies around the world. 
        Generally, cloud computing has replaced hard drives because many users have started to use 
        cloud computing to access software and store their data. So, for software employees and 
        engineers, they will need getting use to cloud computing and gain knowledges about this 
        technology so that they can make the most of it. In Vietnam, this technology is still 
        a vague for lots of people, they only stop at researching this but not getting used to it. 
        That is why in order to make the work more effective, Vietnam must start developing skills 
        about cloud computing.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; In my daily life, cloud computing has affected me a lot. With cloud computing, 
        I do not have to worry about buying a hard drive to store and back up my files anymore. 
        It is very useful to recover files after any accidents and it is very fast and convenient. 
        Communicating with my friends and families has become a lot easier thanks to cloud computing, 
        now I can access to any software as long as I have access to the Internet. Another thing is 
        that I can also store telephone numbers on cloud. Whenever I change my phone, I have to 
        reinstall my telephone numbers which takes a lot of times. Thanks to cloud, whenever I add 
        a new phone number, it will automatically update on cloud.
        <br>
        <br><strong>&emsp; Cybersecurity and privacy</strong>
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; All the organizations have to face a lot of threats that can cause data 
        stolen and attacks. In order to prevent these from happening, understanding about 
        cybersecurity and privacy is the key factor to solve this problem.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; All the organizations have to face a lot of threats that can cause data stolen 
        and attacks. In order to prevent these from happening, understanding about cybersecurity 
        and privacy is the key factor to solve this problem.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; Nowadays, cybersecurity is the most important objective that every company and 
        organization must focus on. In order to gain the trust from customer and keep their 
        information safe, they must minimize the risk and fix the error. And the only one 
        who can fix the errors is human.
        <br>
        <br>&emsp; In recent years, there has been a number of webpages being attacked by hackers, 
        and a thousand of computer being infected by virus, especially in Vietnam. The purpose 
        of these attacks are data and money stolen, taking over control, changing and modifying data, 
        posting fake news, etc. The reasons responsible for this are variable:
        <ul>
            <li>Due to the rapid development of information technology, internet has provided 
                chances and motivations to develop social and economic, but it also provides 
                challenges. For example, there will some gaps in new technology which can be bypassed 
                and attacked by hackers, causing them to break the laws.</li>
            <li>Another reason is that cybersecurity and privacy protection have not been given 
                enough adequate attention.</li>
            <li>What is more, because of this rapid development, we have to keep on investing money 
                on new technology, which makes it very difficult for developing country like 
                Vietnam.</li>
        </ul>
        &emsp; Despite of these challenges and difficulties, there are something that can be done now:
        <ul>
            <li>In order to fight against threats and hackers, one of the most important solutions 
                is human resources. IT professionals and staffs play a vital role in preventing 
                cybercrimes, that is why company must provide policy for them in order to gain 
                knowledges about new technology and promote all their professional capabilities.</li>
            <li>Government and companies also must strengthen data protection, research and find 
                suitable methods to prevent cybercrimes.</li>
        </ul>
        &emsp; Also, every person can follow these steps to protect ourselves from cybercrimes:
        <ul>
            <li>Updating software and operating system so that these will install the latest security 
                patches.</li>
            <li>We can also use anti-virus software to detect and remove threats from our devices.</li>
            <li>Whenever we set up passwords, we must use strong passwords to make sure that these 
                passwords cannot be easily guessed.</li>
            <li>Avoid emails or phone calls from unknown contacts, avoid accessing to strange 
                websites.</li>
            <li>Finally, we should limit using Wi-Fi in public places.</li>
        </ul>
        &emsp; In my daily life, cybersecurity has helped me a lot. Thanks to this technology, 
        if my data is stored on the Internet, it will be protected by cybersecurity. What is 
        more, cybersecurity gives me an opportunity to gain more knowledges about information 
        technology, how data is stored and protected, how these prevent crimes and threats on 
        the internet.
        </p>
        <h3>&emsp; 6. IT Work</h3>
        <p>
        &emsp; I have viewed 5 IT professionals and the sources which are:
        <ol>
            <li>Steve Jobs: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Steve-Jobs">https://www.
                britannica.com/biography/Steve-Jobs</a></li>
            <li>Bill Gates: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates">https://www.
                britannica.com/biography/Bill-Gates</a></li>
            <li>Mark Zuckerberg: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Zuckerberg">
                https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mark-Zuckerberg</a></li>
            <li>Michael Dell: <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Dell">
                https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Dell</a></li>

                https://www.britannica.com/biography/Tim-Berners-Lee</a></li>
        </ol>
        &emsp; These IT professionals have invented new technologies and changed the technology 
        all around the world, which leave huge impacts. In order to explore and trade ideas about 
        technology, they have to interact with lots of people, and most of these people are IT
