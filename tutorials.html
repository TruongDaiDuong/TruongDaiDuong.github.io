        <h3>&emsp; 1. Overview of Git and GitHub</h3>
        <p><strong>&emsp; a. Git:</strong>
            <br>&emsp; Git is a Distributed Version Control System (which can be called DVCS). 
            Thanks to Git, the code management and developer teamwork have become simpler and more convenient. 
            Also, Git provides each programmer with a separate repository containing a complete history of changes.
            <br>&emsp; These are the common benefits when using Git:
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to use, fast and very fast.</li>
                <li>Easy to combine branches together, help code development in teamwork much simpler.</li>
                <li>Can clone code source from the repository or clone a modified version from the repository, 
                    or a branch from a repository so that you can work anywhere.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong>&emsp; b. GitHub:</strong>
            <br>&emsp; GitHub is a project and code management system, with the purpose of acting like a social 
            network for programmers. Also, GitHub is a popular service which can provide storage to save Git 
            source code for software projects. Aside from having all Git features, GitHub also provides features about 
            social so that the developers can easily communicate with each other.
            <br>&emsp; Social networking features that GitHub includes are feeds, feedbacks and network graph so that 
            the developers can learn from each other through commit history.
            <br>&emsp; These are the reasons you should use GitHub:
            <ul>
                <li>Easy to manage source code.</li>
                <li>Can track changes through versions</li>
                <li>GitHub helps improving your coding skills, not to mention tracking bugs.</li>
                <li>GitHub is a useful resource.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p><strong><i>&emsp; In conclusion, Git and GitHub have become influential factors in the open source community. 
            Nowadays, using Git and GitHub is mandatory if you want to apply for jobs. That is why you should learn 
            about Git and GitHub now.</i></strong></p>
        &emsp;
        <h3>&emsp; 2. How to install Git and GitHub</h3>
        <p>&emsp; There are two ways to install Git and GitHub:
            <br><strong>&emsp; a. Install Git (and also GitHub) using GitHub Desktop:</strong>
            <br>&emsp; Step 1: Go to this website: <a href="https://desktop.github.com/ ">https://desktop.github.com</a> 
            and download GitHub Desktop. 
            <br>&emsp; Step 2: Open GitHub Desktop Setup and wait for GitHub to be installed.
            <br>&emsp; <strong>Note: </strong>installing GitHub Desktop will also install the latest version of Git if 
            you have not downloaded Git yet.
            <br>&emsp; Step 3: Once GitHub Desktop opened, log in with your GitHub account and you can start using GitHub 
            on your desktop.
            <br><strong>&emsp; b. Install Git only: (this method is used only when you want to use GitHub directly on GitHub 
            website and do not want to use GitHub on desktop):</strong>
            <br>&emsp; Step 1: Go to this website: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>
            <br>&emsp; Step 3: Open Git Setup and follow the instructions as provided in the Git Setup wizard screen until 
            the installation is complete.
            <br>&emsp; <strong>Note: </strong>these instructions are most for Windows, as because Mac and Linux usually 
            already have Git installed. However, if you did not have Git installed for whatever reason, you can install 
            Git using the methods on top.
        </p>
        <p><i>&emsp; To verify that Git has been installed, open up your terminal application and type ‘git version’ to see 
        whether Git is installed or not and which version it is, or it will alert you that git is an unknown command.</i></p>
        &emsp;
        <h3>&emsp; 3. Some basic Git commands</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 1/ git config: </strong>to set username and email in the main configuration file.
            <br>&emsp; To check username and email, type <i>git config -- global user.name</i> and 
            <i>git config -- global user.email.</i>
            <br>&emsp; To set new username and email, type <i>git config -- global user.name = “your_username”</i> and 
            <i>git config -- global user.email = “your_useremail”.</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 2/ git init: </strong>to create new git repository, project or repository which is already had on server.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git init</i> in the project original folder.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 3/ git clone: </strong>to copy one git repository from the remote source.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git clone <(clone git url)></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 4/ git status: </strong>to check files status you have changed in your working directory.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git status</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 5/ git add: </strong>to add the files and folders you want to the staging area.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git add *</i> to add all files, type <i>git add (file name)</i> to add your selected file.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 6/ git commit: </strong>to save a snapshot about your changes in your working directory. And all the 
            changed files, folders must be in the staging area. Every time commit it will save history changes with the username 
            and email of who has commit. In Git, you can also restore these files in its commit history.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git commit --m ”(Message so that you can note the changes)”</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 7/ git push: </strong>after you had added and committed the changes, you can do this to push all these 
            changes to your local repository.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git push</i> after git add and git commit.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 8/ git pull: </strong>to pull all the updates from your local repository and apply these updates on your code.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git pull</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 9/ git branch: </strong>to list all the branches.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git branch</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 10/ git checkout: </strong>to move to the other branch.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git checkout <(branch name)></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 11/ git stash: </strong>to save changes that you do not want to commit now.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git stash</i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 12/ git merge: </strong>to merge two branches together.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, move to the branch that you want to merge and type 
            <i>git merge <(branch that you want to merge with)></i>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>&emsp; 13/ git reset: </strong>to remove files and folders you have added to the staging 
            area so that these files will not be committed.
            <br>&emsp; To do this, type <i>git reset HEAD (file name)</i>
        </p>
        &emsp;
        <h3>&emsp; 4. Branching</h3>
        <p>
            &emsp; Branch is a function use for branching and storing history changes. Branch which has been 
            branched will not affect other branches so it can be modified in the same repository at the same time. 
            Moreover, branches can be merged into one branch through using git merge.
            <br>&emsp; Branching will be used when a team member wants to create a branch for their own work and do 
            not want to affect the work of other members. After that, members who have finished their works and changes 
            will start adding these to the main branch. In this way, other member’s works will not be affected, and you 
            can also do your own work. Furthermore, by saving works and changes history, if there is any conflicts or problems, 
            it will be easier to solved through checking history.
            <br>&emsp; When committing for the first time in a repository, Git will create a branch automatically which is named main. 
            So, every commit will be added to the main branch in the future until the user switches to another branch.
            <br>&emsp; Here are some commands about branching:
            <ul>
                <li>git branch: to check all the branches in a project. If there are no branches except from the 
                    main branch, then there will be no results.</li>
                    <strong>Important note:</strong> before creating a new branch, you must commit the main branch so that Git will 
                    understand what the main branch is. If not, there will be an error. So first, commit then you can create a new 
                    branch.
                <li>To create a new branch, type <i>git branch (new branch name)</i></li>
                <li>To switch to the branch you just create, type <i>git checkout (branch name)</i></li>
                <li>If you want to delete a branch from Git, type <i>git branch -d (branch name)</i>. But to do that, 
                    you must not in the branch you want to delete, so the best way is to switch to the main branch and 
                    then you can delete branch.</li>
                <li>To switch back to the main branch, just type <i>git checkout main</i></li>
                <li>If you want to merge branches together, first switch to the branch you want to merge and type <i>git 
                    merge (branch name)</i>.</li>
            </ul>
